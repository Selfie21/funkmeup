This is a Dance Game for Android or iOS that let's you check if your groove is lit enough.
Checking is done via the eSense Headphones. Sadly I couldn't include Audio Assets because of copyright, the pre-coded demo is [September](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gs069dndIYk) by Earth, Wind & Fire.

The game was done using flutter together with the [Flame Engine](https://flame-engine.org/). Prebuilt APK is also available in the top layer of the Repository.
